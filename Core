why spring?
  : to simplify Enterprise Java Development.
  
  Goals: 
  lightweight development with Java POJOS (plain old java Objects)
  promote loose coupling by making use of Dependency injection(instead of harwirding the objects together simply specify wiring via configuration file/ Annotations)
  Declarative Programming with AOP  : ex adding application wide services to some java objects
  Minimize boilerplate java code
  
  
  Spring Core Container:
  
  Beans
  Core
  SpEL
  Context
  
  Spring core container contains a BeansFactory for creating Beans and Managing DEpendency Injection
  SpEl: is a spring expression language which is used in config file to refer one bean to another.
  Context is the container which holds the beans in memory
  
  
  
  Spring Infrastructure:
  
  AOP
  Aspects,
  Instrumentation,
  Messaging
  
  
  AOP: Aspect oriented programming.helpful in adding functionality to objects declaratively. ex: logging,security, transactions etc.
