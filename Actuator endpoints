Spring boot Actuator is usefull in monitoring and managing the Application Health.

In Pom.XMl file we need to use:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator<artifactId>
</dependency>


in Application.yaml / properties file we need to diable the security for actuator endpoints.

management.security.enabled =false;

if we enable the port , application will run on 2 ports

management.port  = 9090

by default application will run on port 8080 and in management port 9090
