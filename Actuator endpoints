Spring boot Actuator is usefull in monitoring and managing the Application Health.

In Pom.xml file we need to add Maven Dependency shown below.

<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator<artifactId>
</dependency>

in Application.yml/properties file we need to disable the security for actuator endpoints.

management.security.enabled =false;

if we enable the port, application will run on 2 ports.
management.port = 9090

by default application will run on port 8080 and in management port 9090.
